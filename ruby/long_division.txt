DIFFICULTY: 6

Create a program for kids that demonstrates how to do long division. That is, it allows the child to enter a dividend and divisor, and then shows what the result looks like if you did the long division on paper. You can see an exact example of such a program here: http://www.webmath.com/divide.html

For the record, these are the division terms:

dividend รท divisor = quotient
